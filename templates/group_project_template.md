PROJECT TITLE
ORGANIZING USER SEARCH HISTORY
=============

# OVERVIEW

- motivation: Users are increasingly pursuing complex task-oriented goals on the Web, such as making travel arrangements, managing finances or planning purchases. To this end, they usually break down the tasks into a few co-dependent steps and issue multiple queries around these steps repeatedly over long periods of time.To better support users in their long-term information quests on the Web, search engines keep track of their queries and clicks while searching online. In this paper, we study the problem of organizing a user’s historical queries into groups in a dynamic and automated fashion. Automatically identifying query groups is helpful for a number of different search engine components and applications, such as query suggestions, result ranking, query alterations, sessionization, and collaborative search


- background literature: 1.	We will focus on evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in capturing query relevance.
2.	Relevance Measure
3.	Online query grouping process
4.	 Similarity function

- basic problem that is being solved: Reduces the searching time for the user and provides more convinience. 


- expected outcomes of your analyis: maintains the user frequiently used data in the database and provides in advance whenever the user clicks about a particular.

# RESEARCH QUESTIONS

1. whenever a person wants to browse for something in a hurry, he don't want to want his time in searching and making entire process again and again.In such situations the person gets irritated. Our aim is to provide flexibility for the user at all situations.



# MODELS AND ANALYSIS


Models and Methods we applied: Generaly we have three modules
1.	Query Group- By this module we find the querries given by the users.
2.	Search history-By this module we always make corresponding search for the data in the history.
3.	Query Relevance and Search logs-Through this module we provide the relavance data very quick to the user.



# CODE AND APPLICATION

Codes used: HTML, Java, JSP,AJAX
Application: In search engines.
